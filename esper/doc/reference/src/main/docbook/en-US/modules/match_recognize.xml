        <para>
			Using <emphasis>match recognize</emphasis> patterns are defined in the familiar syntax of regular expressions. 
		</para>
		
        <para>
			The match recognize syntax presents an alternative way to specify pattern detection as compared to the EPL pattern language described in the previous chapter. A comparison of match recognize and EPL patterns is below.
		</para>
		
        <para>
			The match recognize syntax is a proposal for incorporation into the SQL standard. It is thus subject to change as the standard evolves and finalizes (it has not finalized yet). Please consult "row-pattern-recogniton-11-public.pdf" for further information.
		</para>

        <para>
			You may be familiar with regular expressions in the context of finding text of interest in a string, such as particular characters, words, or patterns of characters. Instead of matching characters, match recognize matches sequences of events of interest.
		</para>
			
        <para>
			Esper can apply match-recognize patterns in real-time upon arrival of new events in a stream of events (also termed incrementally,  streaming or continuous). Esper can also match patterns on-demand via the <literal>iterator</literal> pull-API, if specifying a named window or data window on a stream (tables cannot be used in the <literal>from</literal>-clause with match-recognize). The engine maintains state for partial pattern matches and match-recognize patterns are therefore stateful constructs.

        <para>
			The synopsis is as follows:
        </para>
        <synopsis>match_recognize (
  [ partition by <emphasis>partition_expression</emphasis> [, <emphasis>partition_expression</emphasis>] [,...]  ]
  measures  <emphasis>measure_expression</emphasis> <literal>as</literal> <emphasis>col_name</emphasis> [, <emphasis>measure_expression</emphasis> <literal>as</literal> <emphasis>col_name</emphasis> ] [,...]
  [ all matches ]

  [ interval <emphasis>time_period</emphasis> [or terminated] ]
  [ define  <emphasis>variable</emphasis> as <emphasis>variable_condition</emphasis> [, <emphasis>variable</emphasis> as <emphasis>variable_condition]</emphasis>  [,...] ]
)</synopsis>

        <para>
			The <literal>match_recognize</literal> keyword starts the match recognize definition and occurs right after the <literal>from</literal> clause in an EPL <literal>select</literal> statement. It is followed by parenthesis that surround the match recognize definition.
        </para>

        <para>
			<literal>Partition by</literal> is optional and may be used to specify that events are to be partitioned by one or more event properties or expressions. If there is no <literal>Partition by</literal> then all rows of the table constitute a single partition. The regular expression applies to events in the same partition and not across partitions.
        </para>
        
        <para>
			The <literal>measures</literal> clause defines columns that contain expressions over the pattern variables. The expressions can reference partition columns, singleton variables, aggregates as well as indexed properties on the group variables. Each <emphasis>measure_expression</emphasis> expression must be followed by the <literal>as</literal> keyword and a <emphasis>col_name</emphasis> column name.
		</para>

        <para>
			The <literal>all matches</literal> keywords are optional and instructs the engine to find all possible matches. By default matches are ranked and the engine returns a single match following an algorithm to eliminate duplicate matches, as described below. When specifying <literal>all matches</literal>, matches may overlap and may start at the same row.
		</para>

        <para>
			The <literal>after match skip</literal> keywords are optional and serve to determine the resumption point of pattern matching after a match has been found. By default the behavior is <literal>after match skip past last row</literal>. This means that after eliminating duplicate matches, the logic skips to resume pattern matching at the next event after the last event of the current match.
		</para>

        <para>
			The <literal>pattern</literal> component is used to specify a regular expression. The regular expression is built from variable names, and may use quantifiers such as <literal>*</literal>, <literal>+</literal>, <literal>?</literal>, <literal>*?</literal>, <literal>+?</literal>, <literal>??</literal>, <literal>{repetition}</literal> and <literal>|</literal> alteration (concatenation is indicated by the absence of any operator sign between two successive items in a pattern).
		</para>

        <para>
			With the optional <literal>interval</literal> keyword, time period and <literal>or terminated</literal> you can control how long the engine should wait for further events to arrive that may be part of a matching event sequence, before indicating a match (or matches) (not applicable to on-demand pattern matching).
		</para>

        <para>
			<literal>Define</literal> is optional and is used to specify the boolean condition(s) that define some or all variable names that are declared in the pattern. A variable name does not require a definition and if there is no definition, the default is a predicate that is always true. Such a variable name can be used to match any row.
		</para>

			<title>Syntax Example</title>
			<para>
				For illustration, the examples in this chapter use the <literal>TemperatureSensorEvent</literal> event. Each event has 3 properties: the <literal>id</literal> property is a unique event id, the <literal>device</literal> is a sensor device number and the <literal>temp</literal> property is a temperature reading. An event described as <literal>"id=E1, device=1, temp=100"</literal> is a <literal>TemperatureSensorEvent</literal> event with id "E1" for device 1 with a reading of 100.
			</para>
	
			<para>
				This example statement looks for two <literal>TemperatureSensorEvent</literal> events from the same device, directly following each other, that indicate a jump in temperature of 10 or more between the two events:
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[select * from TemperatureSensorEvent
match_recognize (

  pattern (A B)
  define 
    B as Math.abs(B.temp - A.temp) >= 10
)]]></programlisting>

			<para>
			  The <literal>partition by</literal> ensures that the regular expression applies to sequences of events from the same device.
			</para>

			<para>
			  The <literal>measures</literal> clause provides a list of properties or expressions to be selected from matching events. Each property name must be prefixed by the variable name.
			</para>

			<para>
			  In the <literal>pattern</literal> component the statement declares two variables: <literal>A</literal> and <literal>B</literal>. As a matter of convention, variable names are uppercase characters.
			</para>

			<para>
			  The <literal>define</literal> clause specifies no condition for variable A. This means that A defaults to true and any event matches A. Therefore, the pattern can start at any event.
			</para>
	
			<para>
			  The pattern <literal>A B</literal> indicates to look for a pattern in which an event that fulfills the condition for variable A is immediately followed by an event that fulfills the condition for variable B.
			  A pattern thus defines the sequence (or sequences) of conditions that must be met for the pattern to fire.

			<para>
				At time 4000 when event with id <literal>E4</literal> (or event E4 or just E4 for short) arrives the pattern matches and produces an output event. Matching then skips past the last event of the current match (E4) and begins at event E5 (the default skip clause is past last row). Therefore events E4 and E5 do not constitute a match.
			</para>

			<para>
				At time 3000, events E1 and E3 do not constitute a match as E3 does not immediately follow E, since there is E2 in between.

			The <literal>pattern</literal> specifies the pattern to be recognized in the ordered sequence of events in a partition using regular expression syntax. Each variable name in a pattern corresponds to a boolean condition, which is specified later
			using the <literal>define</literal> component of the syntax. Thus the <literal>pattern</literal>  can be regarded as implicitly declaring one or more variable names; the definition of those variable names appears later in the

			<title>Eliminating Duplicate Matches</title>

			<para>
				The execution of match recognize is continuous and real-time by default. This means that every arriving event, or batch of events if using batching, evaluates against the pattern and matches are immediately indicated. Elimination of duplicate matches occurs between all matches of the arriving events (or batch of events) at a given time.
			</para>
			
			<para>
				As an alternative, and if your application does not require continuous pattern evaluation, you may use the <literal>iterator</literal> API to perform on-demand matching of the pattern. For the purpose of indicating to the engine to not
				generate continuous results, specify the <literal>@Hint('iterate_only')</literal> hint.
			</para>

			<para>
				When using one-or-more, zero-or-more or zero-or-one quantifiers (<literal>?, +, *, ??, +?, *?</literal>), the output of the real-time continuous query can differ from the output of the on-demand <literal>iterator</literal> execution: The continuous query will output a match (or multiple matches) as soon as matches are detected at a given time upon arrival of events (not knowing what further events may arrive). The on-demand execution, since it knows all possible events in advance, can determine the longest match(es). Thus elimination of duplicate matches can lead to different results between real-time and on-demand use.
			</para>
			
			<para>
				If the <literal>all matches</literal> keywords are specified, then all matches are returned as the result and no elimination of duplicate matches as below occurs.
			</para>
			
			<para>
				Otherwise matches to a pattern in a partition are ordered by preferment. Preferment is given to matches based on the following priorities:
			</para>
			
			<orderedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						A match that begins at an earlier row is preferred over a match that begins at a later row.
					</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						Of two matches matching a greedy quantifier, the longer match is preferred.
					</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						Of two matches matching a reluctant quantifier, the shorter match is preferred.
					</para>

			</para>

			<orderedlist numeration="arabic">
				<listitem>
					<para>
						The first match by preferment is taken.
					</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>

						The pool of matches is reduced as follows based on the SKIP TO clause: If SKIP PAST LAST ROW is specified, all matches that overlap the first match are discarded from the pool. If SKIP TO NEXT ROW is specified, then all matches that overlap the first row
of the first match are discarded. If SKIP TO CURRENT ROW is specified, then no matches are discarded.
					</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						The first match by preferment of the ones remaining is taken.

		 If your application uses match-recognize in multiple EPL statements and all such match-recognize constructs should count towards a total number of states counts, you may consider setting a maximum number of states, engine-wide, via the configuration described in <xref linkend="config-engine-matchrecognize-max"/>.
