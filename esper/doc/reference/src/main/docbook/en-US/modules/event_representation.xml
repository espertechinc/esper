	<para>
		Esper uses the term <emphasis>event type</emphasis> to describe the type information available for an event representation.
	</para>
	
	<para>
	    Your application may configure predefined event types at startup time or dynamically add event types at runtime via API or EPL syntax. See <xref linkend="configuration-items"/> for startup-time configuration and <xref linkend="api-admin-runtime-config"/> for the runtime configuration API.
	</para>

	<para>
	    The EPL <literal>create schema</literal> syntax allows declaring an event type at runtime using EPL, see <xref linkend="epl_createschema"/>.

    <para>
		In <xref linkend="api-event"/> we explain how an event type becomes visible in EPL statements and output events delivered by the engine.

			Combinations are also possible. For example, a valid combination could be <literal>person.address('home').street[0]</literal>.

		<para>
			You may use any expression as a mapped property key or indexed property index by putting the expression within parenthesis after the mapped or index property name. Please find examples below.

		<sect2 xml:id="eventrep-properties-escaping">
		   <title>Escape Characters</title>
			<para>
				If your application uses <literal>java.util.Map</literal>, <literal>Object[]</literal> (object-array) or XML to represent events, then event property names may themselves contain the dot ('.') character. The backslash ('\') character can be used to escape dot characters in property names, allowing a property name to contain dot characters. 
			</para>
			
			<para>
				For example, the EPL as shown below expects a property by name <literal>part1.part2</literal> to exist on event type <literal>MyEvent</literal>:
			</para>
			<programlisting>select part1\.part2 from MyEvent</programlisting> 

			<para>
				Sometimes your event properties may overlap with EPL language keywords or contain spaces or other special characters. In this case you may use the backwards apostrophe <literal>`</literal> (aka. back tick) character to escape the property name.
			</para>
			
			<para>
				The next example assumes a <literal>Quote</literal> event that has a property by name <literal>order</literal>, while <literal>order</literal> is also a reserved keyword:
			</para>
			<programlisting>select `order`, price as `price.for.goods` from Quote</programlisting> 

			<para>
				When escaping mapped or indexed properties, make sure the back tick character appears outside of the map key or index.
			</para>

			<para>
				The next EPL selects event properties that have names that contain spaces (e.g. <literal>candidate book</literal>), have the tick special character  (e.g. <literal>children's books</literal>), are an indexed property (e.g. <literal>children's books[0]</literal>) and a mapped property 
				that has a reserved keyword as part of the property name (e.g. <literal>book select('isbn')</literal>):

		   <title>Expression as Key or Index Value</title>
	   
			<para>
				The key or index expression must be placed in parenthesis.  When using an expression as key for a mapped property, the expression must return a <literal>String</literal>-typed value. When using an expression as index for an indexed property, the expression must return an <literal>int</literal>-typed value.

  Map<String, InnerType> innerTypesMap;	// mapped property
  InnerType[] innerTypesArray; // indexed property
}

public class InnerType {
  String name;
  int[] ids;
}]]></programlisting>

			<para>
				A sample EPL statement demonstrating expressions as map keys or indexes is:

		<para>
			Dynamic (unchecked) properties are event properties that need not be known at statement compilation time. Such properties are resolved during runtime: they provide duck typing functionality.
		</para>
			
		<para>
			The idea behind dynamic properties is that for a given underlying event representation we don't always know all properties in advance. An underlying event may have additional properties that are not known at statement compilation time, that we want to query on. The concept is especially useful for events that represent rich, object-oriented domain models.
		</para>

		<para>
			The syntax of dynamic properties consists of the property name and a question mark. Indexed, mapped and nested properties can also be dynamic properties:

		<para>
			 Dynamic properties always return the <literal>java.lang.Object</literal> type. Also, dynamic properties return a <literal>null</literal> value if the dynamic property does not exist on events processed at runtime. 
		</para>

		<para>
			As an example, consider an OrderEvent event that provides an "item" property. The "item" property is of type <literal>Object</literal> and holds a reference to an instance of either a Service or Product. 
		</para>

		<para>
			Assume that both Service and Product classes provide a property named "price". Via a dynamic property we can specify a query that obtains the price property from either object (Service or Product):
		</para>
		<programlisting><![CDATA[select item.price? from OrderEvent]]></programlisting>		

		<para>
			 As a second example, assume that the Service class contains a "serviceName" property that the Product class does not possess. The following query returns the value of the "serviceName" property for Service objects. It returns a <literal>null</literal>-value for Product objects that do not have the "serviceName" property:
		</para>
		<programlisting><![CDATA[select item.serviceName? from OrderEvent]]></programlisting>		

		<para>
			Consider the case where OrderEvent has multiple implementation classes, some of which have a "timestamp" property. The next query returns the timestamp property of those implementations of the OrderEvent interface that feature the property:
		</para>
		<programlisting><![CDATA[select timestamp? from OrderEvent]]></programlisting>		
		
		<para>
			The query as above returns a single column named "timestamp?" of type <literal>Object</literal>. 			
		</para>

		<para>
			When dynamic properties are nested, then all properties under the dynamic property are also considered dynamic properties. In the below example the query asks for the "direction" property of the object returned by the "detail" dynamic property:
		</para>
		<programlisting><![CDATA[select detail?.direction from OrderEvent]]></programlisting>		
		<para>
			Above is equivalent to:

				<para>
                    The <literal>exists</literal> function checks whether a dynamic property exists. It returns <literal>true</literal> if the event has a property of that name, or false if the property does not exist on that event.
                </para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>

	<sect1 xml:id="eventrep-fragment">
	   <title>Fragment and Fragment Type</title>
		<para>
			Sometimes an event can have properties that are itself events. Esper uses the term <emphasis>fragment</emphasis> and <emphasis>fragment type</emphasis> for such event pieces. The best example is a pattern
			that matches two or more events and the output event contains the matching events as fragments. In other words, output events can be a composite event that consists of further events, the fragments.
		</para>

		<para>
			Fragments have the same metadata available as their enclosing composite events. The metadata for enclosing composite events contains information about which properties are fragments, or have a property value that can be 
			represented as a fragment and therefore as an event itself.
		</para>

		<para>
			Fragments and type metadata can allow your application to navigate composite events without the need for using the Java reflection API and reducing the coupling to the underlying event representation.
			The API is further described in <xref linkend="api-event"/>.

		<para>
				For NEsper .NET also see <xref linkend="appendix_dotnet_eventrep_javabean"/>.
		</para>

		<para>
			Plain-old Java object events are object instances that expose event properties through JavaBeans-style getter methods. Events classes or interfaces do not have to be fully compliant to the JavaBean specification; however for the Esper engine to obtain event properties, the required JavaBean getter methods must be present or an accessor-style and accessor-methods may be defined via configuration.
		</para>

		<para>
			Esper supports JavaBeans-style event classes that extend a superclass or implement one or more interfaces. Also, Esper event pattern and EPL statements can refer to Java interface classes and abstract classes. 
		</para>

		<para>
			Classes that represent events should be made immutable. As events are recordings of a state change or action that occurred in the past, the relevant event properties should not be changeable. However this is not a hard requirement and the Esper engine accepts events that are mutable as well.
		</para>

		<para>
			The <literal>hashCode</literal> and <literal>equals</literal> methods do not need to be implemented. The implementation of these methods by a Java event class does not affect the behavior of the engine in any way.
		</para>

		<para>
			Please see <xref linkend="configuration"/> on options for naming event types represented by Java object event classes.
			Java classes that do not follow JavaBean conventions, such as legacy Java classes that expose public fields, or methods not following naming conventions, require additional configuration. Via configuration it is also possible to control case sensitivity in property name resolution. The relevant section in the chapter on configuration is <xref linkend="config-java-legacy"/>.

			<para>
				Assume there is an <literal>NewEmployeeEvent</literal> event class as shown below. The mapped and indexed properties in this example return Java objects but could also return Java language primitive types (such as int or String). The <literal>Address</literal> object and <literal>Employee</literal> can themselves have properties that are nested within them, such as a street name in the <literal>Address</literal> object or a name of the employee in the <literal>Employee</literal> object.

	public String getFirstName();
	public Address getAddress(String type);
	public Employee getSubordinate(int index);
	public Employee[] getAllSubordinates();
}
]]></programlisting>

				<para>
					<emphasis>Simple</emphasis> event properties require a getter-method that returns the property value. In this example, the <literal>getFirstName</literal> getter method returns the <literal>firstName</literal> event property of type String.
				</para>
		
				<para>
					<emphasis>Indexed</emphasis> event properties require either one of the following getter-methods. A method that takes an integer-type key value and returns the property value, such as the <literal>getSubordinate</literal> method, or a method that returns an array-type, or a class that implements <literal>Iterable</literal>. An example is the <literal>getAllSubordinates</literal> getter method, which returns an array of Employee but could also return an <literal>Iterable</literal>. In an EPL or event pattern statement, indexed properties are accessed via the <literal>property[index]</literal> syntax.
				</para>
		
				<para>
					<emphasis>Mapped</emphasis> event properties require a getter-method that takes a String-typed key value and returns the property value, such as the <literal>getAddress</literal> method. In an EPL or event pattern statement, mapped properties are accessed via the <literal>property('key')</literal> syntax.
				</para>
		
				<para>
					<emphasis>Nested</emphasis> event properties require a getter-method that returns the nesting object. The <literal>getAddress</literal> and <literal>getSubordinate</literal> methods are mapped and indexed properties that return a nesting object. In an EPL or event pattern statement, nested properties are accessed via the <literal>property.nestedProperty</literal> syntax.
				</para>
	
				<para>
					All event pattern and EPL statements allow the use of indexed, mapped and nested properties (or a combination of these) anywhere where one or more event property names are expected. The below example shows different combinations of indexed, mapped and nested properties in filters of event pattern expressions (each line is a separate EPL statement):

					Similarly, the syntax can be used in EPL statements in all places where an event property name is expected, such as in select lists, where-clauses or join criteria.

				When your getter methods or accessor fields return a parameterized type, for example <literal>Iterable&lt;MyEventData&gt;</literal> for an indexed property or <literal>Map&lt;String, MyEventData&gt;</literal> for a mapped property, then property expressions may refer to the properties available through the class that is the type parameter.

		    Part of the extension and plug-in features of Esper is an event representation API. This set of classes allow an application to create new event types and event instances based on information available elsewhere, statically or dynamically at runtime when EPL statements are created. Please see <xref linkend="custom-event-representation"/> for details.
		</para>
		    
		<para>
			Creating a plug-in event representation can be useful when your application has existing Java classes that carry event metadata and event property values and your application does not want to (or cannot) extract or transform
such event metadata and event data into one of the built-in event representations (POJO Java objects, Map, Object-array or XML DOM).
		</para>

		<para>
			Further use of a plug-in event representation is to provide a faster or short-cut access path to event data. For example, access to event data stored in a XML format through the Streaming API for XML (StAX) is known to be very efficient. A plug-in event representation can also provide network lookup and dynamic resolution of event type and dynamic sourcing of event instances.

        <para>
			To summarize, an event is an immutable record of a past occurrence of an action or state change, and event properties contain useful information about an event.
        </para>

        <para>
			The length of time an event is of interest to the event processing engine (retention time) depends on your EPL statements, and especially the data window, pattern and output rate 
			limiting clauses of your statements.
        </para>

        <para>
			During the retention time of an event more information about the event may become available, such as additional properties or changes to existing properties. 
			Esper provides three concepts for handling updates to events.
        </para>
        
        <para>
			  The first means to handle updating events is the <literal>update istream</literal> clause as further described in <xref linkend="epl-update"/>. It is useful when you need to update events as they enter a stream, before events are evaluated by any particular 
			  consuming statement to that stream.
        </para>

        <para>
			  The second means to update events is the <literal>on-merge</literal> and <literal>on-update</literal> clauses, for use with tables and named windows only, as further described in <xref linkend="named_upsert"/> and <xref linkend="named_update"/>. On-merge
			  is similar to the SQL <literal>merge</literal> clause and provides what is known as an "Upsert" operation: Update existing events or if no existing event(s) are found then insert a new event, all in one atomic operation provided by a single EPL statement. 
			  On-update can be used to update individual properties of rows held in a table or named window.
        </para>

        <para>
			  The third means to handle updating events is the revision event types, for use with named windows only, as further described in <xref linkend="named_versioning"/>. With revision event types one can declare, via configuration only, multiple different event types and then
			  have the engine present a merged event type that contains a superset of properties of all merged types, and have the engine merge events as they arrive without additional EPL statements.
        </para>

		<para>
			Note that patterns do not reflect changes to past events. For the temporal nature of patterns, any changes to events that were observed in the past do not reflect upon current pattern state.
		</para>

		<indexterm><primary>event</primary><secondary>coarse</secondary></indexterm>
		<indexterm><primary>event</primary><secondary>bulk</secondary></indexterm>

        <para>
			Your application events may consist of fairly comprehensive, coarse-grained structures or documents. For example in business-to-business integration scenarios, XML documents or other event objects can be rich deeply-nested graphs of event properties.
        </para>

        <para>
			To extract information from a coarse-grained event or to perform bulk operations on the rows of the property graph in an event, Esper provides a convenient syntax: 
			When specifying a filter expression in a pattern or in a <literal>select</literal> clause, it may contain a contained-event selection syntax, as further described in <xref linkend="epl-containedeventselect"/>.

		<para>
			For NEsper .NET also see <xref linkend="appendix_dotnet_eventrep_insertinto"/>.
		</para>

        <para>
			The <literal>insert into</literal> clause can populate instantiate new instances of Java object events, <literal>java.util.Map</literal> events and <literal>Object[]</literal> (object array) events directly from the results of <literal>select</literal> clause expressions and populate such instances. Simply use the event type name as the stream name in the <literal>insert into</literal> clause as described in <xref linkend="epl-insert-into"/>.
        </para>
        
        <para>
           If instead you have an existing instance of a Java object returned by an expression, such as a single-row function or static method invocation for example, you can transpose that expression result object to a stream. This is described further in <xref linkend="insert-into-expression"/> and <xref linkend="functionreference-transpose"/>.
        </para>

        <para>
			The column names specified in the <literal>select</literal> and <literal>insert into</literal> clause must match available writable properties in the event object to be populated (the target event type). The expression result types of any expressions in the <literal>select</literal> clause must also be compatible with the property types of the target event type.
		</para>

        <para>
			If populating a POJO-based event type and the class provides a matching constructor, the expression result types of expressions in the <literal>select</literal> clause must be compatible with the constructor parameters in the order listed by the constructor. The <literal>insert into</literal> clause column names are not relevant in this case.
		</para>

        <para>
			Consider the following example statement:
		</para>
		<programlisting>insert into com.mycompany.NewEmployeeEvent 
select fname as firstName, lname as lastName from HRSystemEvent</programlisting> 

        <para>
			The above example specifies the fully-qualified class name of <literal>NewEmployeeEvent</literal>. The engine instantianes <literal>NewEmployeeEvent</literal> for each result row and populates the <literal>firstName</literal> and <literal>lastName</literal> properties of each instance from the result of <literal>select</literal> clause expressions. The <literal>HRSystemEvent</literal> in the example is assumed to have <literal>lname</literal> and <literal>fname</literal> properties, and either setter-methods and a default constructor, or a matching constructor.
		</para>
		
        <para>
			Note how the example uses the <literal>as</literal>-keyword to assign column names that match the property names of the <literal>NewEmployeeEvent</literal> target event. If the property names of the source and target events are the same, the <literal>as</literal>-keyword is not required.
		</para>

        <para>
			The next example is an alternate form and specifies property names within the <literal>insert into</literal> clause instead. The example also assumes that <literal>NewEmployeeEvent</literal> has been defined or imported via configuration since it does not specify the event class package name:
		</para>
		<programlisting>insert into NewEmployeeEvent(firstName, lastName) 
select fname, lname from HRSystemEvent</programlisting> 

        <para>
			Finally, this example populates <literal>HRSystemEvent</literal> events. The example populates the value of a <literal>type</literal> property where the event has the value 'NEW' and populates a new event object with the value 'HIRED', copying the <literal>fname</literal> and <literal>lname</literal> property values to the new event object:
		</para>
		<programlisting>insert into HRSystemEvent 
select fname, lname, 'HIRED' as type from HRSystemEvent(type='NEW')</programlisting> 

        <para>
          The matching of the <literal>select</literal> or <literal>insert into</literal>-clause column names to target event type's property names is case-sensitive. It is allowed to only populate a subset of all available columns in the target event type. Wildcard (<literal>*</literal>) is also allowed and copies all fields of the events or multiple events in a join.
		</para>

        <para>
			For Java object events, your event class must provide setter-methods according to JavaBean conventions or, alternatively, a matching constructor. If the event class provides setter methods the class should also provide a default constructor taking no parameters. If the event class provides a matching constructor there is no need for setter-methods. If your event class does not have a default constructor and setter methods, or a matching constructor, your application may configure a factory method via <literal>ConfigurationEventTypeLegacy</literal>. If your event class does not have a default constructor and there is no factory method provided, the engine uses in connection with the Oracle JVM the <literal>sun.reflect.ReflectionFactory</literal>, noting that in this case member variables do not get initialized to assigned defaults.
		</para>

        <para>
			The engine follows Java standards in terms of widening, performing widening automatically in cases where widening type conversion is allowed without loss of precision, for both boxed and primitive types and including BigInteger and BigDecimal.
		</para>

        <para>
			When inserting array-typed properties into a Java, Map-type or Object-array underlying event the event definition should declare the target property as an array.
		</para>
