    <title>Output Reference and Samples</title>

    <para>
		This section specifies the output of a subset of EPL continuous queries, for two purposes: First, to help application developers understand streaming engine output in response to incoming events and in response to time passing. Second, to document and standardize output for EPL queries in a testable and trackable fashion. 
    </para>

    <para>
		The section focuses on a subset of features, namely the time window, aggregation, grouping, and output rate limiting. The section does not currently provide examples for many of the other language features, thus there is no example for other data windows (the time window is used here), joins, sub-selects or named windows etc.
    </para>

    <para>
		Rather then just describe syntax and output, this section provides detailed examples for each of the types of queries presented. The input for each type of query is always the same set of events, and the same timing. Each event has three properties: symbol, volume and price. The property types are string, long and double, respectively.
    </para>

	<para>
		The chapters are organized by the type of query: The presence or absence of aggregation functions, as well as the presence or absence of a <literal>group by</literal> clause change statement output as 
		described in <xref linkend="processingmodel_aggregation"/>.
	</para>       

	<para>
		You will notice that some queries utilize the <literal>order by</literal> clause for sorting output. The reason is that when multiple output rows are produced at once, the output can be easier to read if it is sorted.
	</para>       
	
	<para>
	    With output rate limiting, the engine invokes your listener even if there are no results to indicate when the output condition has been reached. Such is indicated as <literal>(empty result)</literal> in the output result columns.
	</para>

	<para>
	    The output columns show both insert and remove stream events. Insert stream events are delivered as an array of <literal>EventBean</literal> instances to listeners in the <literal>newData</literal> parameter, while remove stream events are delivered to the <literal>oldData</literal> parameter of listeners. Delivery to observers follows similar rules.
	</para>

		<para>
			For the purpose of illustration and documentation, the example data set demonstrates input and remove streams based on a time window of a 5.5 second interval. The statement utilizing the time window 
			could look as follows:
		</para>

		<programlisting><![CDATA[select symbol, volume, price from MarketData#time(5.5 sec)]]></programlisting>

		<para>
			We have picked a time window to demonstrate the output for events entering and leaving a data window with an expiration policy. The time window provides a simple expiration policy based on time: if an event resides in the time window more then 5.5 seconds, the engine expires the event from the time window.
		</para>

		<para>
			The input events and their timing are below. The table should be read, starting from top, as "The time starts at 0.2 seconds. Event E1 arrives at 0.2 seconds with properties [S1, 100, 25]. At 0.8 second event E2 arrives with properties [S2, 5000, 9.0]" and so on.

				Output occurs when the output condition is reached after each 1-second time interval. For each event arriving, the new aggregation value is output as part of the insert stream. As part of the remove stream, the prior aggregation value is output. This is useful for getting a delta-change for each event or group. If there is a <literal>having</literal> clause, the filter expression applies to each row.
