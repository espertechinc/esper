Changes in version 4.2.0
------------------------
Major API or EPL changes
  - Support for enumeration methods, which work with lambda expressions to perform common tasks on subquery results, named windows, event properties or inputs that are or can be projected to a collection of events, scalar values or objects.
  - Support for date-time methods for date and time manipulation and querying, such as for adding or subtracting time periods, setting or rounding calendar fields and querying fields.
  - Support for @Audit annotation which instructs the engine to output detailed debug-level information about the statements processing, such as pattern instance counts, expression result values, property values and more.
  - Support for Virtual Data Window, an extension point for (large) external data stores to become accessible same as a named window.
  - Support for the 'new' operator, which populates a new data structure by evaluating column names and assignment expressions, useful when an expression should return multiple results, for performing a transformation or inside enumeration method lambda expressions.
  - Support for constructor injection for event objects populated by insert into.
  - Support for the on-merge clause to allow multiple actions (multiple then-clauses), to allow insert-into a stream other then the currently-merged named window and adding support for an optional where-clause for each action.
  - Support for mapped and indexed properties to allow an expression as a map key or index.
  - Support for expression declarations. Expressions that are common to multiple places in an EPL statement can be moved to a named expression declaration and reused within the statement without duplicating the expression itself.
  - Improvement for query planning and indexing for joins, subqueries, on-merge/select/update/delete, fire-and-forget queries and create-index to support btree indexes for use with ranges, inverted ranges and relational operator (>, <, >=, <=) queries. 
  - Improvements to statement metrics reporting in regards to event counts and reporting for named windows.

Changes in version 4.0.0
------------------------
Major API or EPL changes
  - Requires a Java 6 runtime (JDK6 or JRE6)
  - The following dependent jar files are upgraded:
       Required: ANTLR version upgrade from 3.1.1 to 3.2
       Optional: LOG4J upgrade from 1.2.15 to 1.2.16
       
  - The bound-repeat syntax in the repeat-until pattern operator changed syntax:
    The old syntax of separating range value by dots "[low .. high]" is no longer supported. Use the colon ":" character instead of "..".
    
  - The meaning of the index paramater to the "nth" aggregation function has changed:
    To be consistent with "prev" and "last" functions an index of zero now returns the current row. 
    For Example: "nth(value, 0)" returns the current row and "nth(value, 1)" returns the previous-row value.
    
  - The semantics for "output first" have changed: For statements that have a "group-by" clause the "output first" now outputs the first events per group.
  
  - The "first" aggregation function has been renamed to "firstever".
  - The "last" aggregation function has been renamed to "lastever". This makes a difference as data window deletes are reflected by the new "last" aggregation function and are not reflected by "lastever".
  - We introduced new aggregation functions that track the data window : "first", "last" and "window" with a convenient syntax for access to all attributes.
  - We introduced new single-row function for data window access: "prevtail", "prevwindow" and "prevcount" functions.
  
  - The data window "std:groupby" for grouped data windows has been renamed to "std:groupwin" to avoid confusion with the group-by clause.

  - Support for registering an exception handler that is called when any continous-query statement exception occurs.
  - Support for all statistics views and the size view to accept additional expressions as parameters for returning values pertaining to the last-applied event.
  - Support for chained method invocations on events in streams, library static methods and single-row functions.
  - Support for registering single-row functions by function name.
  - Support for dot-syntax in the form of "(expression).method(...).method(...)" which includes support for duck typing, obtaining array size and calling get(index) on an array or collection.
  - Support for subqueries to select multiple columns.
  - Support for correlated aggregation in subqueries.
  - Support for selecting multiple columns in a subquery.
  - Support for contained-event syntax on events selected from a named window.
  - Support for expressions in the [] bound repeat in patterns.
  - Support for grouped data windows to remove groups that haven't changed for a given time period, as specified via hint.

  - To be congruent to the JDBC 4 specification, the SQL query metadata now uses the value returned by the JDBC driver result set metadata for "getColumnLabel" as the column name or if that is null the value returned by "getColumnName".
  - For plug-in aggregation functions, the parameter to the "validate" method has changed and is now a validation context that provides additional information. The "validateMultiParameter" method has been removed.
  - We added a new example demonstrating runtime configuration.

Minor changes  
  - Fixed issue ESPER-471 Static method called 'join' (reserved keyword) not allowed
  - Fixed issue ESPER-481 Create-Window with explicit column-types does not support column types that are an event type (documentation bug/improvement)

  - Fixed issue ESPER-466 First-length and first-unique combined to intersection (multiple data windows) to reduce insert stream
  - Fixed issue ESPER-495 Support XPath attribute node list result casted to string array
  - Fixed issue ESPER-487 Custom aggregation functions - pass indicator whether running windowed and allow access to child expressions
  - Fixed issue ESPER-496 On-select with stream wildcard and aggregation produces event-per-group and not event-per-row

  - Support for expressions in parameters to SQL statements.
  - Preemptive processing of events inserted into named windows. This helps to make behavior of queries with named windows more intuitive.
  - Support for a new pattern guard "timer:withinmax". It takes a time period and maximum-count and ends the pattern subexpression when either the stopwatch or counter match.
  - Support for a new pattern guard post-fix operator "while": Similar to a while loop, ends the pattern subexpression when an expression turns false.

------------------------

Major API changes
  - None
  
New Features
  - Support to the proposed SQL standard "match_recognize", a regular expression-based event pattern matching language
  - Support for isolated service providers, which allow to control event visibility and time-related behavior on a statement level, i.e. suspend, preload or catch-up statements

  - Fixed issue ESPER-362 Error "Iteration over a unidirectional join is not supported" at statement start in a stream to window join
  - Documentation and performance improvements


Changes in version 3.1.0
------------------------

Major API changes
  - The behavior of "timer:within" when used within an "every" in a pattern has changed: The sub-expression qualified by "timer-within" upon expiry 
    of the timer now evaluates to permanently false, while previously it simple stopped. This allows the "every" operator to restart such sub-expression.
    For example, the expression:
      every(A -> (B where timer:within(5 sec)))
    ... When no B event arrives after an A event, the "every" restarts the subexpression looking for the next A followed by B within 5 sec.
  - The PluginLoader interface for writing adapters has a new required method that must be implemented to allow plugins to initialize after complete Esper engine initialization.
  - The provider URI of the default engine instance is now "default" instead of null.
    This is for consistency with the default engine qualifier for optional use in stream and property name qualification, which is also "default".
    Therefore EPServiceProviderManager.getDefaultProvider().getURI() returns "default", and passing null to the EPServiceProviderManager still returns the default instance.

New Features
  - A new "every-distinct" operator has been introduced to the pattern language. Very similar to the "every" operator, this operator
    suppresses duplicate results received from sub-expressions based on a set of expressions returning distinct-values.
  - The EPL language now understands annotations following the annotation syntax standard.
    An annotation is an addition made to information in a statement. Esper provides certain built-in annotations for
    defining statement name (@Name), adding a statement description (@Description) or for tagging statements.
    Applications can provide their own annotation classes that the EPL compiler can populate.
  - The engine now provides a way to prioritize and preempt processing of an event when multiple statements must process the event,
    via the @Priority and @Drop annotations.
  - The insert-into clause can now directly populate an underlying event object from a select clause.
  - We have extended the on-insert syntax by a new split-stream syntax. This allows to list multiple insert-into, select clauses and where-clauses
    thereby making it easy to split or duplicate an event stream into multiple further event streams.

Minor changes  
  - Fixed Issue ESPER-350 Timer-Within should evaluate to permanently false allowing every to restart the expression
  - Fixed Issue ESPER-349 Exception barrier to lock taken missing from filter processing potentially causing deadlock after an exception occurs
  - Fixed Issue ESPER-348 XML event type fails to be configured with XSD on Java 6
  - Fixed Issue ESPER-347 NullPointer with time_batch and START_EAGER with named window
  - Fixed Issue ESPER-346 NullPointerException in on-select with aggregation and empty window
  - Fixed Issue ESPER-345 NPE is thrown when evaluating statement with 'OR' in its having-clause.
  - Fixed Issue ESPER-344 Pattern cleanup incomplete causing memory leaks
  - Fixed Issue ESPER-343 Esper shouldn't log ExprValidationException
  - Fixed Issue ESPER-341 Variable used with XML no-schema event in same statement creates ambigous property exception

  - Fixed Issue ESPER-335 pluginloader stop called after engine runtime destroy
  - Fixed Issue ESPER-334 PluginLoader reentrancy on Configuration
  - Fixed Issue ESPER-333 Pattern followed-by expression to detect when no subexpressions are alive and indicate permanently false so "every" can restart
  - Fixed Issue ESPER-332 NullPointerException in on-select with having clause for timer excution
  - Fixed Issue ESPER-331 Runtime exception barrier for listener and subscriber
  - Fixed Issue ESPER-328 Aggregation function nested created NPE in Timer thread
  

Changes in version 3.0.0
------------------------

Major API changes
  - The summary of changes are:
    - Upgraded version of dependent jar files 
    - Moved EventType, EventBean and related exception classes from package com.espertech.esper.event to com.espertech.esper.client
    - Several minor rename of methods in the Configuration API related to event type name retiring "alias" as a word in method names
    - EPL division expressions yield double-type results
    - EPL view and pattern parameters strongly distinquish between string constant and property name
    - EPL join statements for certain stream types now require a data window declaration
    - EPL when using multiple data windows defaults to intersection semantics
    - Extension API for views, pattern objects and event representations have additional or slighly changed signatures
    
New Features
  - The view parameters and pattern object parameters are now expressions. Thereby they gain certain new features: 
    - Variables may be used to parameterize views or pattern objects; 
    - Prepared statements may use substitution parameters to parameterize views and pattern objects;
    - Pattern objects may be parameterized by prior events;
    - The syntax for views namespace.name('property') is no longer supported.
  - New syntax to support contained-event selection, for use with coarse-grained events that contain finer-grained events or rows.
    This allows convenient extraction and analysis of information from business-level composite events.    
  - Added XML and JSON renderers for output events
  - When using multiple data windows for the same stream in EPL, the default policy is intersection of data windows, and a union-policy is also available via keyword. 
    This allows concise declaration and combination of multiple expiry policies and well-defined semantics.
  - We have made substantial internal enhancements to the type system to simplify and support transposing from any type of stream to an event property in a further stream.
  - Enhanced the XML DOM event to support: The changes gained features to transposing XPath expression results between statements and including arrays,
    as well as transposing property expression results. The changes also correct a problem in which an expression "index[1]" accessed the firs element in a collection and not the second.
  - Added a new method for statements to add a listener with replay in one transaction, by name "addListenerWithReplay".
  - The EPL now returns a double-type result for division expressions where both operands to a division were non-FP types, such as "1/2", i.e. double 0.5. 
    This follows SQL standards and makes EPL easier to read and use. Esper 2.x returned an integer value following Java standards (i.e. zero).
  - The EPL does no longer assume keep-all semantics if no data window is specified for a filter-based or pattern-based stream in a join. 
    EPL now requires a data window to be explicitly defined to applicable streams.   
  - Added support for SQL-standard ANY, SOME and ALL keywords in group comparison.  
  - Added advanced threading options to configuration for use with inbound, outbound and execution threading at engine-level.  
  - Improved support for Java-object event representation with parameterized types (Java generics), List and Iterable properties.  
  - Added support for escaping property names and event type names in case an overlap occurs with keywords.
  - New configuration options to change the caching behavior for UDF invocations.

------------------------
* (EQL and Event Pattern) Event inheritance and interface implementation support; Added support for interfaces, 
abstract classes, superclasses. E.g. select * from IMyEvent  (where IMyEvent) is an interface or superclass, and event classes that 
implement this interface or extend the superclass match the criteria.
* (EQL and Event Pattern) Added support for simple, mapped, indexed, nested and any combination of these anywhere where
and event property name is expected. E.g. subordinate[3].address(home).city
